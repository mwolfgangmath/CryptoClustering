# CryptoClustering
Module 19 HW


In this challenge,Iâ€™ll use my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

After scaling data, inertia values will be plotted and visualized to identify the optimal k-value, using the elbow method.

Then, the features will be reduced using PCA and re-clustered to see comparative groupings.
